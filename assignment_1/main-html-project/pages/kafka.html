  <p>The Metamorphosis, written by Franz Kafka is a novel written in 1915. 
    It tells the tale of a man, called Gregory Samsa, who is turned into an insect. We explore the hardship and rejection through his eyes, as his family continue to shun him.

  <h3>
    My thoughts on this book:
  </h3>
  <p>In my opinion, this is Kafka's finest work. The depressing narrative is coerced by the spectacular and descriptive writing.</p>
